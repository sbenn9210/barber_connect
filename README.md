App connecting barbers and salons to customers.

## What It Is
This is a full stack web app allowing barbers to create profiles, hightlight skills, list pricing, and automate scheduling in order to provide a better experience for customers. 

## What I Used
* React
* Redux
* Bootstrap
* JSX
* Express.js
* Node.js
* mLab
* JWT
* Body-Parser
* Passport
* Font Awesome


## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
* Create a MongoDB database to contain the comprehensive list of barbers and detailed information about their business
* Integrate JWT and passport for user login
* Develop forms to allow individuals to register a themselves
* Allow access to the general public to search the database

## My Stretch Goals
* Create a google map showing all barbers in the area
* Create an automated scheduler for appointment booking
